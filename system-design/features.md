    - [x] Determine width/height of texture with 0-copy of texture data
    - [x] Determine sky
      - starts with "sky"
    - [x] Determine fluid
      - starts with *
    - [x] Determine animated (and framecount)
      - starts with "+"
      - has digits preceding any text in name
      - parse digits (figure out if it ends at 9 or needs padding)
      - works differently than model animations
    - [ ] Determine hidden
      - in list of hidden names ("clip", "trigger", "skip", etc)
      - find exhaustive list
    - [ ] Determine if emissive
      - scan each pixel (at each mip? at highest mip?) and see if the index is >= (256 - 32)
    - [ ] Determine if transparent
      - scan each pixel and see if the index is 255 (works differently than model textures)
